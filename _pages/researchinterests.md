## Research Interests

In my dissertation, I am exploring infants' and young children's social networks. My research both 1) describes the nature and structure of these networks and 2) explores how aspects of social networks relate to social cognition. Click here to learn more about the method I developed to quantify young children's social networks - the [Social Network Survey](https://nicoleburke.github.io/socialnetworksurvey/).

In another line of research, I collaborate with Jenny Lu to look at how langugage experience affects adults' and children's social attention in communicative contexts. We examine deaf and hearing adults' and children's attention and comprehension of co-speech gesture to understand how early language experience affects social cognition.
