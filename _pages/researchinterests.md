## Research Interests

I am a fourth year PhD student in Developmental Psychology at the University of Chicago. I am interested in early infant social cognition. In my dissertation, I am exploring infant social networks. Through my research, I hope to describe the nature and structure present in infant social relationships as well as explore how social relationships impact early social cognition.
