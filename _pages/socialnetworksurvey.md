# Social Network Survey 

The Social Network Survey is a method I developed to get information about a child's social network. Through parent interview, parents will describe their child's "typical week". The parent interview detrimines the boundaries of the network - which people should be included. The Social Network Survey then collects demographic information to assess various aspects of children's network;the Linguistic Diversity, Racial Diversity, Age Diversity, Proportion of Kin relationshps, and how relationships cluster together. These metrics can be used to characterize children's early social experience. 

If you are interested in using the Social Network Survey, please feel free to contact me at [nicoleburke@uchicago.edu](mailto:nicoleburke@uchicago.edu). Below is a description of the R package I created to extract the Social Network Survey from the Qualtrics survey.  

## SocialNetworkSurvey - R package. 

SocialNetworkSurvey is a R package I developed available on my [Github](https://github.com/nicoleburke/Social-Network-Survey). This package contains the functions neccessary to extract the Social Network data from the Qualtrics output.
