## About Me

I am a fifth year PhD student in Developmental Psychology at the University of Chicago working with [Dr. Amanda Woodward](http://woodwardlab.uchicago.edu/) and [Dr. Susan Goldin-Meadow](https://voices.uchicago.edu/goldinmeadowlab/). I am interested in early infant social cognition. In my dissertation, I am exploring infants' and young children's social networks - I hope to describe the nature and structure present in young children's social networks as well as explore how social networks impact early social cognition. I argue that social networks are the best tool for characterizing young children's early social experience.

## Background 

I graduated with a B.A. in Psychology and Cognitive Science from Northwestern University in 2015. As an undergraduate, I worked with Dr. Amy Booth and Dr. Sandra Waxman at Northwestern and Dr. Frank Keil at Yale University studying word learning, language development, children’s causal reasoning, and adult’s reasoning about explanatory depth.
