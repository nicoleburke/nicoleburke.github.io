## About Me

I am a sixth year PhD Candidate in Developmental Psychology at the University of Chicago working with [Dr. Amanda Woodward](http://woodwardlab.uchicago.edu/) and [Dr. Susan Goldin-Meadow](https://voices.uchicago.edu/goldinmeadowlab/). 

In my dissertation, I am exploring infants' and young children's social networks. I argue that social networks are an excellent method to capture and describe children's early social experience and that we can use a social network framework to generate questions about how early social experience relates to social cognitive development.

Follow me on [Twitter!](https://twitter.com/nicoleburke0) I tweet about R, Network Science, current events, and my daily struggle with writing. 


## Background 

I am a first-generation college student and I graduated with a B.A. in Psychology and Cognitive Science from Northwestern University in 2015. 

As an undergraduate, I worked with [Dr. Sandra Waxman](https://childdevelopment.northwestern.edu/) and [Dr. Amy Booth](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/littlelearnerslab/) at Northwestern and [Dr. Frank Keil](https://cogdevlab.yale.edu/) at Yale University studying word learning, language development, children’s causal reasoning, and adult’s reasoning about explanatory depth.
