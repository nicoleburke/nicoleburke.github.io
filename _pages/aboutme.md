## About Me

I am a fifth year PhD candidate in Developmental Psychology at the University of Chicago working with [Dr. Amanda Woodward](http://woodwardlab.uchicago.edu/) and [Dr. Susan Goldin-Meadow](https://voices.uchicago.edu/goldinmeadowlab/). I am interested in early infant social cognition. In my dissertation, I am exploring infants' and young children's social networks - I describe the nature and structure present in young children's social networks as well as explore how social networks impact early social cognition. I argue that social networks are an excellent tool for characterizing young children's early social experience.
